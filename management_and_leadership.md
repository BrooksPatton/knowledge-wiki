### Kendal Miller

* To the original question about balance? I think it’s a fundamental belief that people are valuable, and the work cant happen without them. You either value your people as the work, or their output. If you value the people… sure wfh is nice, but you’ll also just take care of people. (edited) 
* You can help people work from home, but if you still question every decision they make, or panic everytime something small happens their lives become miserable
* work life balance is about feeling valued as a human being at work.
* that means the ability to take time off
* not work crazy hours
* but it also means having some kind of autonomy in what you’re doing
* being entrusted to do a thing
* having people not treat you like shit
* you can work 40hrs/week and have a terrible work/life balance because you’re utterly destroyed at work those 40 hours.
* Work life balance is about acknowledging that people are people.
* and treating like such
* many places treat people as less than human means to an output end.
* so practical things? Sure, as their manager provide and expect sane hours
* don’t lose your shit when someone calls in sick
* trust people to do their jobs
* praise them when they do a good job
* understand when their kid is sick and they’re going to miss a meeting
* take vacation yourself so others feel they can
* fight for your people and protect them from the bullshit above
* fail at all of these things and apologize when you do
* be human yourself
* and let failure happen.
