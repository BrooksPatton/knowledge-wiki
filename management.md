## Transition into Management role

* Opinions from our teammates will be formed much quicker than we might assume
* Figuring out what the break even point is, and meeting it as quickly as possible is the goal. The break even point is when we are providing as much value to the organization as we are consuming from it. For example a developer may take six or so months to truly know and understand the technical stack, culture of the company, and the values of the customer before they are able to provide value without needing another team member to help them. After meeting the break even point everything they do is value adding and worth the investment of the company.
* Potential traps
  * Action imperative - not learning about the needs of the new role before taking action now by doing what worked in previous roles.
  * Setting unrealistic expectations - claiming that we are going to move the sun and moon before we know what it is that is we are doing, or the team we'll be doing it with
  * Attempting to do too much - Focusing on too many things, and therefor don't really do anything at all
  * Coming in with the answer - Mind made up from the beginning, or making up our mind before getting all the information
  * Engaging in the wrong kind of learning - Learning too much about technical, or cultural, or political
  * Wrong kind of relationships
  * Only focusing on avoiding negative traps - we need to create positive habits and virtuous cycles as well

### Checklists

* What will it take to reach the break even point more quickly?
* What are some traps I might encounter, and how can I counter them?
* What can we do to create virtuous cycles?
* What types of transitions are we experiencing?
* What are the key elements in my 90 day plan?

### Risk assessment

* Create a risk assessment, what can go wrong, what is the impact, and how can it be mitigated?
