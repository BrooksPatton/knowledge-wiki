# Time Management

## Prioritizing

A four by four grid can be used to determine which projects / tasks are the most important to work on and which ones only seem important at first glance.

From top to bottom, left to right

1. High Urgency High Importance - these are the tasks that will cause tremendous damage if they aren't done now. For example a bill for electricity, or sending services to customers.
2. High Importance Low Urgency - These are the tasks and projects that will help you reach your goals and ambitions in the future. There usually aren't any deadlines in this area.
3. High Urgence and Low Importance - These are tasks that will cause emotional distress when the deadlines pass but won't cause any real damage. Missing a movie at the movie theater, or getting your employees status reports often fall in this category
4. Low Urgency and Low Importance - Often these are fun things or busy work that don't move the needle on anything. Hanging out on social media or mindlessly micromanaging employees for no reason end up here

## Delegating

Delegating can happen vertically or horizontally. Vertical delegation is where a manager or executive hands a task or project off to someone lower on the corporate ladder than them. This can also happen up too, asking a manager to take care of a task on behalf of an individual contributor.

Horizontal delegation is where someone hands off a task or a project to someone at the same level on the organizional chart as themselves. This is really common and important skill to learn as it can be a way to self manage and keep the teams working with less management from a manager.

Regardless of the direction of delegation, these are good steps involved in the delegation process

**Start with why**

When we take on a task for ourselves its really important to understand why the task needs to be done in order for us to decide how much energy or what priority we are going to give it. Also, _you will be punished if you don't_ is not an acceptable why. In that case its time to get a new job.

If we want to know why we are taking on tasks when being delegated too, then they people we delegate our tasks to want to know why as well. It can and will create a more collaborative environment.

**Be extremely clear**

It's very easy to assume that what we know about a project or task is common knowledge with the person that we are delegating to. However that isn't always the case. Sometimes we assume without even realizing it. Therefore it's a very good idea to delegate in person or over video chat in order to make sure that the scope of what is being delegated is absolutely clear.

That leads to the next part of delegating

**Check for understanding**

Double check that the delegatee fully understands what you want by asking one or two clear questions about the project or task. If they can't answer then the explanation wasn't good enough. Go back and try again with a slightly different approach. Repeat until the CFU (Check for understanding) succeeds.

**Set expectations**

This doesn't necessarily mean setting deadlines, but if there is one this is the time to set it. Make sure that everyone knows when the task is due and why you want it by then.

Once you do this

**Be available**

but not micro-managy. This means making sure that you are visible and ready to help out if needed, but don't ask about the project constantly. Maybe not even at all. Bringing up the projects is good at business one on ones that are scheduled.
