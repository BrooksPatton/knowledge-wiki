# Knowledge Wiki

I know this isn't really a wiki. But the GitHub wiki didn't allow me to edit things from the command line, or accept pull requests so I am kind of using this as a wiki. 

Here I'll be storing the information that I've gathered. It's mainly for me but I hope it'll be helpful for everyone!

## Topics

### Business

* [management and leadership](management_and_leadership.md)
* [metrics](metrics.md)

### Databases
